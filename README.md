## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Eddie Ramirez and I am an MBA candidate with the UC Davis Graduate School of Management. I am fairly new to Github. 
I have experience using R and STATA to create models for public policy research in Southern California. I am currently learning 
SQL to have a better understanding of CRM platforms such as SLATE. I'm looking to learn more about data analytics, including 
but not limited to, building AI models to make processes more efficient in the healthcare space.
